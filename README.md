CLEO mods for GTA:SA
---------------------

Credits go to Junior_Djjr for his great and complete scripting tutorials and the MixMods community, I would've never learned basic cleo scripting without his tutorials :)
Visit his website at: https://forum.mixmods.com.br

feel free to do whatever you want with the source codes, I don't mind
(P.S. I'm an amateur when it comes to coding)

have a nice day :)
